# Proteomics R utility functions

This repository contains a collection of R helper functions that I developed
during my doctoral research in quantitative proteomics and multi-omics data analysis.

The focus of this code is on:

- reproducible and reusable data processing workflows
- quality control and exploratory analysis of MaxQuant or DIA-NN-based proteomics data
- time-resolved and cyclic protein and phosphosite profiling
- publication-ready visualization using ggplot2

The functions were developed to support large-scale quantitative proteomics
projects and are designed to be imported into an R session and reused across
different datasets.

This repository reflects my transition towards data science and computational
roles in translational and biomedical research.
